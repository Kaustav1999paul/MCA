DataLink Layer:

> Responcible for the delivery of message
> Checks and makes sure that the delivery of data is error free or not
> The packets received from the Network Layer to the DLL are further divided into frames depending upon the frame size of the NIC (Network Interface Card).
> When frame buffer is full, it stops the transmitting signals.

Devices in DLL: Swithces and bridges
NOTE: [The physical Layer, DLL and NL comes under the hardware and the rest 4 comes under the software.So the OSI reff model is the combo of H/W and S/W]

Functions of DLL: 
> Node to Node Delivery
> Framing: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/framing-in-data-link-layer/
> Physical Addressing: DLL adds physical address of sender or receiver in the header of each frame.
> Error Control: It re-transmits the damaged or lost frames (CRC | CheckSum | Parity)
> Access Control
> Flow controle: When the frame buffer is full, it will stop the transmission. when it is empty it will again 			 transmit it. (Stop and Wait | Go back N | Selective repeat)
